# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Build a machine learning regression model to predict housing prices based on various socio-economic and geographic features.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature selection (correlation analysis, variance analysis)
3. Train-test split
4. Model training:
   - **Linear Regression**

5. Model Evaluation:
   - R² Score
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 🤖 Models Used
- **Linear Regression:** Baseline model with decent performance and easy interpretability.
  

## 📈 Results
- Visual comparison of predicted vs actual prices
- Identified key features influencing housing prices (e.g., RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO)
